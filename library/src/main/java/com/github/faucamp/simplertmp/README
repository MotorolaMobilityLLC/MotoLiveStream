SimpleRtmp - Client-side RTMP library for Java
==============================================

SimpleRtmp is a Java library for building RTMP client applications.
It was written entirely from scratch to avoid issues I encountered with existing Java
RTMP libraries - namely that most of them are based off the (excellent) Red5 Flash Media
Server's codebase, which requires a working NIO implementation (Android 2.2, I'm looking at you).
I also did not like all of the external dependencies introduced by this. Whilst it 
is fine for a server, I needed something more lightweight.

This library focuses *only* on client-side RTMP implementation (and
is very unlikely to ever have a server-side component); it currently also only allows
for audio playback (as this is what I needed it for). 

Patches are welcome!

Requirements

- Java 5 or later
